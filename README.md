#  Personal Ethereum Projects for learning
##

## Steps for environment configuration
1. Install vscode
2. Install 'solidity' vscode extension (I'm using the 'Nomic Foundation' version)
3. For backend testing, we have a few options.
	- hardhat, foundry, ape
   We will use ape due to being more fluent in python
   pip install eth-ape'[recommended-plugins]'

## Goals
1. Create a smart contract
2. Run static analysis on contract
3. Create tests around contract functions
